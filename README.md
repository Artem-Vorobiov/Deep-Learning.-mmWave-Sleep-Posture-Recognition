## **Abstract**
The recognition of sleep posture is crucial across multiple domains, including:

- **Sleep Healthcare**
- **Care for Bedridden Patients**
- **Diagnosis of Chronic Diseases**

Recent research has increasingly focused on utilizing **deep neural networks** for human posture classification using **mmWave Radars**. This thesis investigates the efficacy of neural networks in classifying sleep postures—**supine**, **lateral**, and **prone**—by leveraging augmented data and analyzing transition states between static postures. The results demonstrate a significant improvement, with accuracy ranging from a baseline model of **77%** to a final theoretical state machine result of **93%**.

## **Skills**
- **Python**
- **PyTorch**
- **NumPy**
- **Pandas**
- **TensorBoard**
- **Radar – Texas Instruments IWR6843 AOP**
